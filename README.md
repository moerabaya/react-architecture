# State Management
How an application handles the data needs of itâ€™s components, with regards to loading, storing, persisting, and sharing this data.
- Context API: Busiltin within react, It's "Small" sized state management
  - Example: [/src/state-management/ContextApi/index.js](/src/state-management/ContextApi/index.js)
- Recoil: A state management library design for "Medium" sized applications. Deep dive into Recoil: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ISAA_Jt9kI
  - Example: [/src/state-management/Recoil/index.js](/src/state-management/ContextApi/index.js)
  - Recoid has two main concepts: Atoms and Selectors, Atoms are individual values that is stored at Recoil state. Selctors take the fundeamental values that are expressed as atoms, and transform them or combine them into another value.
- Redux: The most popular state management library design for "Large" sized applications. Deep dive into redux/toolkit: https://redux-toolkit.js.org/introduction/getting-started
  - Example: [/src/state-management/Redux/index.js](/src/state-management/Redux/index.js)
  - Redux has several key parts:
    - actions: plain javascript object that contains information, they are dispatched when an even occurs.
    - reducers: pure functions that take an action and the previous state of the application and returns the new state.
    - store: is an immutable object tree which holds the application's state, it acts as the single source of truth. Redux can have only one store.
    - selectors: is a function that accepts Redux state as an argument and returns data that is derived from that state.
